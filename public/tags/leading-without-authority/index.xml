      <description>I’ve been listening to Leading Without Authority on Audible. Purchase it here.&#xA;When the author mentions “team” here, he doesn’t mean organizational structure. Instead, he means who are the people that are relevant and can help you accomplish your goal. These are the people you want to build relationships with, get to know, and build trust with.&#xA;I can’t say that any of the ideas in this section were new to me.</description>
