_I’ve been listening to Leading Without Authority on Audible. [Purchase it here](https://www.audible.com/pd/Leading-Without-Authority-Audiobook/0593149807)._

When the author mentions “team” here, he doesn’t mean organizational structure. Instead, he means who are the people that are relevant and can help you accomplish your goal. These are the people you want to build relationships with, get to know, and build trust with.

I can’t say that any of the ideas in this section were new to me. I learned a few years ago how important relationships were. I’ve also told other people that if you want to improve, you need to find a person who you respect and look up to that can be brutally honest with you with feedback on things you can improve. The most important thing is that you actually do care what they think despite everyone else telling you not to care about what everyone thinks of you. Being receptive to how you are perceived is important to growth.
