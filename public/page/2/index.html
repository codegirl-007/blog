I’ve finished the first two chapters of this book and my first impression is that it started out slow but quickly picked up pace and jumped right into the details. I still have a long ways to go before finishing the book but so far, I think I like it. I’ve dissected a small part of the first chapter and compiled some of my notes.
The g in “gRPC” stands for something different in every release. I didn’t know this. I just assumed that it stood for Google. Very clever.</p></div>

“The question isn’t ‘What are we going to do?’ The question is ‘What are we not going to do?’” — Ferris Bueller
In an ever changing world where companies try to be innovative and progress in their business, the culture will certainly change as evolution happens. If you remain at a company for a significant length of time, you’ve probably seen this happen.
In my experience, these are some lessons I’ve learned:
Things will change. Process will change. Values will change. Priorities will change. People will change.</p></div>

              <div class="summary"><p>I’m always fascinated about what is achievable without Javascript. So when I was reading this article about how Bear Blog does analytics with CSS, I decided to do my own experimentation. The concept here is to use css to trigger certain endpoints by using properties that require loading an image (or something).
To do this, I spun up an ExpressJS app and created a simple endpoint that started out with just outputting certain params. I kept it simple in the beginning as I just needed a feedback mechanism for the requests my CSS was making. If I were to use this somewhere, I would need some sort of data store to persist data.</p></div>
