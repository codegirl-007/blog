      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve did something I rarely ever do. I paid for lifetime access to Neetcode.io. It happened one late night while I was browsing Youtube. I stumbled on a video that showed a person going through his Data Structures and Algorithms course and they really sold me on doing the same.&#xA;So far, I&amp;rsquo;m really loving it. I&amp;rsquo;m slowly progressing through it and so far, the Leetcode problems haven&amp;rsquo;t been too bad at all (especially since Neetcode has video solutions explaining every step of the way).</description>
