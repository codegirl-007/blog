I stumbled on a video that showed a person going through his Data Structures and Algorithms course and they really sold me on doing the same.
So far, I’m really loving it. I’m slowly progressing through it and so far, the Leetcode problems haven’t been too bad at all (especially since Neetcode has video solutions explaining every step of the way).</div>

One day while talking to some people about reading books and such, I became fascinated with how much Bill Gates reads. I watched a video on YouTube about his “Think Week” where he would take off to a cabin to read and think. One day I want to do the same.
Following my own curiosity about Bill Gates, I went to the library to check out books on Bill Gates called Bill Gates Speaks.</div>

I honestly haven’t made a ton of progress because I’ve read and re-read the same few pages while doing the coding examples. However, I did get through most of chapter 2 which gives a very preliminary introduction to using Protobuf and gRPC. I have one more thing to do to finish it off which is running building and running the app (all done through the coding examples that they give, none done from my own creativity).</div>

I’ve finished the first two chapters of this book and my first impression is that it started out slow but quickly picked up pace and jumped right into the details. I still have a long ways to go before finishing the book but so far, I think I like it. I’ve dissected a small part of the first chapter and compiled some of my notes.</div>

“The question isn’t ‘What are we going to do?’ The question is ‘What are we not going to do?’” — Ferris Bueller
In an ever changing world where companies try to be innovative and progress in their business, the culture will certainly change as evolution happens. If you remain at a company for a significant length of time, you’ve probably seen this happen.</div>

              <div class="summary">I’m always fascinated about what is achievable without Javascript. So when I was reading this article about how Bear Blog does analytics with CSS, I decided to do my own experimentation. The concept here is to use css to trigger certain endpoints by using properties that require loading an image (or something).
To do this, I spun up an ExpressJS app and created a simple endpoint that started out with just outputting certain params.</div>

When the author mentions “team” here, he doesn’t mean organizational structure. Instead, he means who are the people that are relevant and can help you accomplish your goal. These are the people you want to build relationships with, get to know, and build trust with.
I can’t say that any of the ideas in this section were new to me.</div>
